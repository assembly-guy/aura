## How it works?
The aim is to keep aura as lightweight as possible therefore when it installs a package aura will:
1. Compose the AUR git url using the AUR git clone url format without doing an extra fetch on the API
2. Run git clone
3. Run makepkg -si
4. Remove the files from step 2 and 3 after the installation was finished

#### NOTE: I've got a ' C# / JS background and  I am experimenting with rust as I want to fully transition to it in the future. Therefore, feel free to contribute even if you are a beginner, we can learn together.
